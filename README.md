# Bear In Mind

Bear In Mind is an application focused towards retaining and applying infomation. 

To help retain infomation, we have have used flashcards that take in user input. The user will input:

- A category
- A question
- An Answer

A random user inputted flashcard will show on mount on the home screen. The user can also press a button to access another or go to the "My Flashcard" page to access all of them.
