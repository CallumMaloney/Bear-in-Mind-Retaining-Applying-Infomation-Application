# Bear In Mind

Bear In Mind is an application focused towards retaining and applying infomation. 

To help retain infomation, we have have used flashcards that take in user input. The user will input:

- A category
- A question
- An Answer

This will all be done on the "Add A Flashcard" Page

A random user inputted flashcard will show on mount on the home screen. The user can also press a button to access another or go to the "My Flashcard" page to access all of them.

In the "My Flashcards" page, the user has the ability to sort flashcards by:

- Category
- Ascending (A-Z)
- Descending (Z-A)

To help apply infomation, we have a "Test Me" page. 

This page allows the user to see a random question to one of the random flashcards on screen. To reveal the answer, the user can press a button. The user can also request another question.
