# Bear In Mind

(Link for app in about section)

Bear In Mind is an application focused towards retaining and applying infomation. 

To help retain infomation, we have have used flashcards that take in user input. The user will input:

- A category
- A question
- An Answer

This will all be done on the "Add A Flashcard" Page

A random user inputted flashcard will show on mount on the home screen. The user can also press a button to access another or go to the "My Flashcard" page to access all of them.

In the "My Flashcards" page, the user has the ability to sort flashcards by:

- Category
- Ascending (A-Z)
- Descending (Z-A)

(In the Demo video, for some reason the drop down menu containing the options mentioned does not appear on the video. After testing, this seems to be an error with the software used to record the demo. When running the app, the drop down menu appears.)

To help apply infomation, we have a "Test Me" page. 

This page allows the user to see a random question to one of the random flashcards on screen. To reveal the answer, the user can press a button. The user can also request another question.

To be added in the future:

- Learning Journal
- Sort By feature implimented on the "Test Me" page
- Category drop down menu seperate from the Sort By menu

Demo of the App:
